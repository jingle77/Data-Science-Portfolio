# ML Model Selection Strategies with Python: Predicting Bank Lead Conversion

####Lab Scenario

In this lab, you'll step into the role of a Lead Data Scientist at "MoneyLink Bank," a leading financial institution focused on modernizing its operations. Faced with the challenge of optimizing the loan approval process, the bank is determined to enhance customer satisfaction while maintaining prudent risk assessment practices. You have been assigned the task of creating and selecting an efficient predictive model that precisely identifies leads with the highest likelihood of loan approval. Your model will contribute to streamlining operations and ensuring accurate decisions in a timely manner. Your final deliverable will be a report comparing different ML models against the selection criteria and a final recommendation of which model meets our requirements most efficiently.

####Goal: Build a machine-learning model that has 95% accuracy on the test set, a prediction time under 0.1 seconds, and can clearly communicate the most important features
